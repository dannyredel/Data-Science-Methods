# Data Science Methods

This website [here](https://ephemeral-malabi-5f3c48.netlify.app/) hosts all the labs and assignments I did during the course “Data Science Methods” (DSM) taught at Tilburg University (2023).

During the course we learn how to employ modern statistical and machine learning techniques to make decisions that involve large data in economics, marketing and finance. Labs and asignments were made using the free software package R and RStudio.
